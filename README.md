Troll your friends with a fake parrot virus!

## Installation
1. Download the ZIP on your friends computer
2. Put either `tab.parrot` or `parrot.bat` somewhere where your friend will probably click it
3. Enjoy them have anxiety
4. Run away as fast as you can

## Notes
### Note 1 : 
> When trolling your friends,
> make sure they are on an admin account
> or they will suffer more

### Note 2 : 
> Your friends computer might think the file is a Trojan Virus, 
> if so use parrot.bat instead of tab.parrot

### Note 3 : 
> Only works on Windows, I will make a Mac version if this gets famous
